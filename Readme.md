# Classification of Algorithms

## Greedy Approach
- **Fractional Knapsack Problem:** Greedy approach to optimize the selection of items with fractional weights for maximum profit.
- **Job Sequencing with Deadline:** Greedy approach to optimize job scheduling based on deadlines.
- **Minimum Spanning Tree (Kruskal's Algorithm):** Greedy approach to find the minimum spanning tree.
- **Minimum Spanning Tree (Prim's Algorithm):** Another greedy approach to find the minimum spanning tree.
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm:** Greedy approach to find the single-source shortest path in a graph.

## Dynamic Programming Approach
- **0/1 Knapsack Problem:** Dynamic programming approach to solve the 0/1 knapsack problem.
- **Multistage Graph:** Dynamic programming approach to find the minimum cost in a multistage graph.
- **All Pairs Shortest Path (Floyd-Warshall Algorithm):** Dynamic programming approach to find the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a weighted graph.
- **Optimal Binary Search Tree:** Dynamic programming approach to find the minimum cost of an optimal binary search tree.
- **Longest Common Subsequence:** Dynamic programming approach to find the longest common subsequence.
- **Travelling Salesman Problem:** Dynamic programming approach to find the shortest possible tour that visits each city exactly once and returns to the original city.

## Backtracking Approach
- **8 Queen's Problem:** Backtracking approach to find all solutions for placing 8 queens on a chessboard.
- **Graph Coloring:** Backtracking approach to find a proper coloring for a graph.
- **Hamiltonian Cycle:** Backtracking approach to find a Hamiltonian cycle in a graph.
- **Sum of Subsets Problem:** Backtracking approach to find all subsets of a given set whose sum is equal to a specified target sum.

## Miscellaneous
- **Bellman-Ford Algorithm:** Used for finding the shortest paths in a graph, but not strictly categorized into one of the classical algorithmic paradigms.
