# Classification of Algorithms

## Greedy Approach
- **Minimum Spanning Tree (Kruskal's Algorithm):** Greedy approach to find the minimum spanning tree.
- **Minimum Spanning Tree (Prim's Algorithm):** Another greedy approach to find the minimum spanning tree.
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm:** Greedy approach to find the single-source shortest path in a graph.
- **Job Sequencing with Deadline:** Greedy approach to optimize job scheduling based on deadlines.

## Dynamic Programming Approach
- **Multistage Graph:** Dynamic programming approach to find the minimum cost in a multistage graph.
- **Optimal Binary Search Tree:** Dynamic programming approach to find the minimum cost of an optimal binary search tree.
- **0/1 Knapsack Problem:** Dynamic programming approach to solve the 0/1 knapsack problem.
- **Fractional Knapsack Problem:** Greedy approach but can be solved using dynamic programming as well.
- **Longest Common Subsequence:** Dynamic programming approach to find the longest common subsequence.

## Backtracking Approach
- **8 Queen's Problem:** Backtracking approach to find all solutions for placing 8 queens on a chessboard.
- **Graph Coloring:** Backtracking approach to find a proper coloring for a graph.
- **Hamiltonian Cycle:** Backtracking approach to find a Hamiltonian cycle in a graph.

## Miscellaneous
- **Bellman-Ford Algorithm:** Used for finding the shortest paths in a graph, but not strictly categorized into one of the classical algorithmic paradigms.
- **Travelling Salesman Problem:** This can be approached using various methods, including dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, or even branch and bound.
